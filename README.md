Semantic HTML elements were added to the source code including: header, nav, figure, main, section, aside, and footer.

The HTML and CSS elements were organized to follow a more logical structure and the heading attributes were arranged in sequential order.

Descriptive ALT attributes were included in each image to make the site more accessible to people with disabilities.

A clear, concise, and descriptive title was added.

Additional improvements were made to fix elements of the page without changing their design or function. The search-engine-optimization link was fixed. The CSS file was consolidated and commented.
